            This is what my first computer looked like. I was born in 2001, which can be considered "recent times" in 
            the informatic panorama. But since then, things have changed a lot. I remember experimenting with this 
            old desktop at the age of five. Back then, there really wasn't much to do, or at least that's what I thought.

        <h3>
            Paint 98
        </h3>
        <p> Windows 98 didn't really have much to offer, but there was one program that kept me hooked for at least 
            two hours a day. Paint is basically the predecessor of Photoshop. With this program you could draw different
            shapes, choose various brush sizes and types, use the bucket tool to fill defined areas, and even add text boxes.
            I remember I used to spend all day making ugly artworks that my parents thought were beautiful and were proud of.

        <h3>
            Minesweeper & Space Cadet
        </h3>
        <p>
            Considering I was a kid, my main interest was having fun playing games, and this old desktop also gave me that 
            possibility. I didn't really know how <em>Minesweeper</em> worked, I guess the rules where too complicated for 
            me at that time, but it was really fun to click casual squares hoping I wouldn't accidentally blow up.
            Last but not least, the best and funniest game of all was definitely Space Cadet, the official name of 
            the famous Pinball game. I think there doesn't need to be any description for this game. Anyone who has owned 
            a Computer with Windows 98 OS is definitely familiar with this game.
