            In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came with their own 
            operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they understood, and programmers 
            needed to write their programs to the specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played 
            a significant role in its success. <br></div>

            it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to develop all sorts. Of the most famous

            The software operating system
        </h3>
        <p>
            A contester to the micro computer was IBM’s so-called <em>Personal Computer</em> or PC, although it was much pricier and did not find its way 
            into normal homes straight away.
            The IBM PC used a software operating system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not 
            need to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was short for Micro-Soft Disk 
            Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days). The code was based on the <em>UNIX</em> operating system, although 
            greatly simplified.
